### Explanation

For made this project we had to use the [_virtualbox_](https://www.virtualbox.org/) program. <br>
Choose between the Debian system or the CentOS system. I chose Debian because is more simple and practical for begginers. <br>
Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using [LVM](https://wiki.debian.org/LVM) (Logical Volume Manager) and anderstand how it works. <br>
Undestand the differences between aptitude and apt, and in case of Debian system, what [Apparmor](https://apparmor.net/) is. <br>
